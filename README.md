# Homework 4 – Data Modeling, Dictionaries, and Crash Analysis

## Overview
This assignment focuses on practical applications of Python dictionaries and basic data modeling techniques to analyze traffic accident datasets. The goal was to simulate real-world data processing by implementing dictionary-based data structures, organizing crash data, and extracting meaningful statistics to inform civil engineering decisions.

## Objectives
- Practice parsing and modeling data using Python dictionaries
- Perform data-driven accident analysis using structured datasets
- Strengthen skills in reading, organizing, and querying tabular data in Python
- Reinforce core programming concepts: loops, conditionals, string formatting, and nested data structures

## Key Concepts and Tools
- **Python**: Core programming language used throughout the assignment
- **Data Modeling**: Creating structured representations of accident data using nested dictionaries
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting statistics such as highest crash counts by month, roadway, or light condition
- **File I/O**: Reading `.csv` datasets and programmatically organizing data
- **Engineering Relevance**: Interpreting results that could support decisions in roadway design and safety analysis

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in manipulating complex data structures in Python
- Translating raw data into structured insights
- Applying computational thinking to solve civil infrastructure-related problems

## Course Context
This homework is part of ENCE201: Computing Fundamentals for Engineers, a hands-on course at the University of Maryland introducing students to numerical computing, programming, and data analysis in engineering. Topics include root-solving, matrix algebra, data modeling, and differential equations — all implemented in Python.
